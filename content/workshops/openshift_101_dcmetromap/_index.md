# Introduction

Welcome to the workshop!  This particular workshop will have you deploying with native docker images as well as using OpenShift to create docker images for a Node.js based website.  You will also be leveraging the power of OpenShift to build, deploy, scale, and automate.

If you are on-site with us, the instructor will walk you through and kick off each lab.  Otherwise, if you're running this on your own, just go through the list of labs below in order (as some build off of each other).
