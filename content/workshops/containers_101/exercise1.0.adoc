= Exercise 1.0 - Install Docker

== Install Docker

.Install Docker
[source, bash]
----
$ sudo -i
# yum install -y docker
----

=== Start Docker

To start the docker binary and have it managed by link:https://fedoramagazine.org/what-is-an-init-system/[`systemd`]
we first need to enable it and tell systemd that we want it to run a boot time.
Then to start the docker daemon right away we use the start command.

[source, bash]
----
systemctl enable docker
----

[source, bash]
----
systemctl start docker
----

[source, bash]
----
systemctl status docker
----

Once docker starts successfully you should see a similar output as below.
