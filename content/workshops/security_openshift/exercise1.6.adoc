= Exercise 1.6 - SCC & Seccomp

In addition to authorization policies that control what a user can do,
OpenShift Container Platform provides security context constraints (SCC) that
control the actions that a pod can perform and what it has the ability to
access. Administrators can manage SCCs using the CLI.

SCCs are objects that define a set of conditions that a pod must run with in
order to be accepted into the system. They allow an administrator to control
the following:

- Running of privileged containers.
- Capabilities a container can request to be added.
- Use of host directories as volumes.
- The SELinux context of the container.
- The user ID.
- The use of host namespaces and networking.
- Allocating an FSGroup that owns the podâ€™s volumes
- Configuring allowable supplemental groups
- Requiring the use of a read only root file system
- Controlling the usage of volume types
- Configuring allowable seccomp profiles

== SCC

=== Step 1:

Change to `root`

----
sudo -i
----

=== Step 2:

.get a current list of SCCs
[source]
----
oc get scc
----

.closer look at the `restricted` SCC
[source]
----
oc describe scc restricted
----

=== Step 3:

*Create a SCC*

As most people at this workshop are security minded people we will skip over
*adding* permissions and capabilities to containers, let's look at how tighten
things up. We will look at *dropping* certain Linux Capabilities in this SCC
file.

.dc17-drop-capabilities.yml
[source]
----
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: dc17-drop
allowPrivilegedContainer: false
runAsUser:
  type: RunAsAny
seLinuxContext:
  type: RunAsAny
fsGroup:
  type: RunAsAny
supplementalGroups:
  type: RunAsAny
users:
- dc17-user
groups:
- dc17-group
requiredDropCapabilities:
- KILL
- MKNOD
- SYS_CHROOT
- SETPCAP
- NET_BIND_SERVICE
- NET_RAW
- SYS_CHROOT
- MKNOD
- AUDIT_WRITE
- SETFCAP
----

[NOTE]
Copy the text above. Type `vim dc17-drop-capabilities.yml`, Press `i` for
Insert, then cut and paste `control + v`, then escape and write the file `esc`,
`:wq`.

[source]
----
oc create -f dc17-drop-capabilities.yml
----

*Step 4:*

*Add SCC to a service account*

Create `Service Account`

.create service account
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Security_Section_9[Section9]
[source]
----
oc create serviceaccount section9
----

.describe service account
[source]
----
oc describe serviceaccount section9
----

Add to service account

.add the policy to the service account
[source]
----
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user dc17-drop  \
    system:serviceaccount:sso:section9
----

Now lets view the policy again and see that our service account was added.

Under:
[source]
----
oc describe scc dc17-drop

...

Access:
  Users: dc17-user,system:serviceaccount:sso:section9
----

== Seccomp

Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls
applications can make, allowing cluster administrators greater control over the
security of workloads running in OpenShift Container Platform. Seccomp support
is achieved via two annotations in the pod configuration:

- seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod: profile applies to all containers
in the pod that do not override
- container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/<container_name>:
container-specific profile override

Applications use `seccomp` to restrict the set of system calls they can make.
Recently, container runtimes have begun adding features to allow the runtime to
interact with `seccomp` on behalf of the application, which eliminates the need
for applications to link against `libseccomp` directly. Adding support in the
Kubernetes API for describing `seccomp` `profiles` will allow administrators
greater control over the security of workloads running in Kubernetes.

The systemd seccomp facility is based on a whitelist of system calls that can
be made, rather than a full filter specification.

*Containers are run with unconfined seccomp settings by default.*

.check to see if seccomp is enabled
[source]
----
cat /boot/config-`uname -r` | grep CONFIG_SECCOMP=
----

Policy Examples:

*Unconfined profile*

Here's an example of a pod that uses the unconfined profile:

.unconfined
[source]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: trustworthy-pod
  annotations:
    seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod: unconfined
spec:
  containers:
    - name: trustworthy-container
      image: sotrustworthy:latest
----

*Custom profile*

Here's an example of a pod that uses a profile called example-explorer profile
using the container-level annotation:

.custom
[source]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: explorer
  annotations:
    container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/explorer:
localhost/example-explorer-profile <1>
spec:
  containers:
    - name: explorer
      image: gcr.io/google_containers/explorer:1.0
      args: ["-port=8080"]
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/mount/test-volume"
          name: test-volume
  volumes:
    - name: test-volume
      emptyDir: {}
----
